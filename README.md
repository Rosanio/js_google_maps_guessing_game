# Google Maps Guessing Game

## Description
This website will load a google map centered in a random city (picked from a predetermined list). The objective is for users to guess what city they are in. Labels are disabled, zoom is limited, and the further away from the center you scroll, the more points you lose. Users can buy labels at the expense of points to make it easier to guess where they are.

## Setup

Clone this repository:
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/Rosanio/js_google_maps_guessing_game
$ cd js_google_maps_guessing_game
```

If you haven't already, install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Then, setup and run npm in the terminal:
```
$ npm init
$ npm install
```

Run bower in the terminal:
```
$ bower install
```

You may need to specifically tell node to install browser-sync:
```
$ npm install browser-sync --save-dev
```

Finally, run gulp in the terminal and you will be able to open index.html normally:
```
$ gulp build
```
